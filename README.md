# React Login Application

This is a simple React-based login application that demonstrates validation, local storage management, and mock API integration.

## Features

- Login form with validation for:
  - Username (only accepts `emilys`)
  - Email (valid email format required)
  - Password (minimum of 8 characters)
- Local storage integration to save mock tokens and user data.
- Logout functionality to clear user data and tokens.
- Responsive design for desktop, tablet, and mobile devices.
